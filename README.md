RQ1: What is cooperative AI? What do you see as the potential that computer science and economics can jointly contribute to advance cooperative AI?

As given in the introduction part, the target of Cooperative AI is to assist humanity in dealing with fundamental problems of cooperation via re-conceiving AI as deeply social (Dafoe et al. 2021). Meanwhile, artificial learning agents in addition to humans are likely to participate more actively with increasing interactions in a variety of complex settings including social dilemmas. Cooperative AI, shedding light on the intersection between game theory and artificial intelligence, holds the potential to navigate social dilemmas well. 

The combination of advanced technology in computer science and individual behavioral microeconomics will contribute to “building machine agents with the capabilities for cooperation”; the existing real practices in constructing an environment and achievement in computer science show the potential for “tools to foster cooperation in populations” of both machine and human agents, which would accelerate cooperative AI research to reach its central goals (Dafoe et al. 2020). Besides, previous theoretical foundations in game theory and social dilemma have offered a solid basis for the research while the multi-agent system in computer science is making the future interaction between machines and human beings possible.

RQ2: Besides the desirable outcomes of cooperation, what other desirable outcomes the mechanism design theory aims at achieving?

Mechanism design adds the assumption that agents will behave to maximize their payoffs as a strategic version of social choice theory under different situations. The computational applications of mechanism design focus on mechanisms that contain an interesting computational ingredient and/or mechanisms applied to computational domains such as computer networks (Haris 2010). The highly influential applications of mechanism design include economics, such as theories of taxation, government regulation, and corporate finance. The most significant application of mechanism design is the design and analysis of auctions. 

The reach of mechanism design theory is very broad. The theory represents a breakthrough in the modern economic analysis of institutions and markets and will have a lasting influence on the design of economic policies. Mechanism design theory tells us when markets or market-based institutions are likely to yield desirable outcomes and when other institutions will be better at achieving the desired goals. Second, mechanism design theory guides us to design such alternative institutions when markets fail. Auctions are one of the early applications of mechanism design theory and one area to which both Maskin and Myerson have heavily contributed. Regulation too has been revolutionized by mechanism design. In work with David Baron, Myerson was the first to abandon the conventional assumption that regulators “know everything” and to use mechanism design to derive optimal regulatory schemes ensuring the provision of public services at least cost. Additionally, mechanism design theory also tells us how to design environmentally sustainable fishing and hunting schemes in natural reserves.

RQ3. What are the limitations of the current mechanism design theory in achieving desirable outcomes? What new challenging are we facing in a new era with more and more human and AI interactions?

The deviation of several impossibility theorems outlines the combinations of properties that no mechanism can achieve with fully rational agents in particular types of environments. A novel class of problems that are approximable in the absence of strategic constraints, and have an optimal incentive-compatible solution when no computational constraints are enforced; under standard computational assumptions, for this class of problems, there is no algorithm with a reasonable approximation ratio that is both computationally feasible and incentive compatible. This settles the central open question in algorithmic mechanism design which, since its inception, has been focused on trying to show the hardness of polynomial-time incentive compatibility. The Gibbard and Satterthwaite impossibility theorem shows that for a sufficiently rich class of agent preferences it is impossible to implement a satisfactory social choice function in dominant strategies. A related impossibility result, due to Green and Laffont and Hurwicz, demonstrates the impossibility of efficiency and budget balance with dominant strategy implementation, even in quasi-linear environments.

The challenge of Mechanism Design has been identified in the ability to provide all the possible solutions among which a designer or even a user can select the one that is considered proper for the need under the solution. As linked to the design problem also the analysis approaches are asked to provide proper new evaluations of the new expected performance.
